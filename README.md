# Hotel reviews: Using NLP to predict star rating from reviews  



## Introduction

In this project, we look at about 515k hotel reviews of 1493 hotels in Europe from booking.com. We analyze the data and find the best model that correctly predicts the star rating of a reviewer based on their reviews. The data file is a .csv file called "Hotel_Reviews.csv" along with 6 Jupyter notebooks corresponding to the different models with the statistical analysis. A Powerpoint of the presentation is also included in the capstone folder.



## Problem Statement:

We want to be able to correctly predict the star rating of a reviewer from their review.


## Executive Summary:

We used different models to correctly predict the star rating of a reviewer from their reviews. I dropped the reviews that had no positive and no negative reviews because those could affect our models. Our best model was logistic regression and it correctly predicts the number of stars corresponding to a certain review with an accuracy of 76%.
